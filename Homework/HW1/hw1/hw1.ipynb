The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

If it does not exist already or if `force=True`, the file at `data_url` is downloaded and placed at `data_dir/file`. The process of storing a data file for reuse later is called caching. If `data_dir/file` already and exists `force=False`, nothing is downloaded, and instead a message is printed letting you know the date of the cached file.\n",
